## 🔧 **If You Want to Try a Different Approach**

### Convert to Pure React (Vite) Setup
If you want maximum compatibility, I can help you convert this to a standard Vite + React setup:

```bash
# This would give you universal deployment compatibility
npm create vite@latest hygeia-health-vite -- --template react-ts
# Then migrate your components over
```

### Use Docker Deployment
For platforms like DigitalOcean, Heroku, or any VPS:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install
COPY . .
RUN bun run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "run", "start"]
```

## 💡 **My Recommendations**

### For Simplicity: **Surge.sh**
```bash
bun run build && cd dist && surge
```

### For Features: **Netlify**
- Best overall platform
- Great Bun support
- Form handling built-in

### For Bun-First: **Railway**
- Native Bun runtime
- Can run your server if needed
- Modern platform

### For Free: **GitHub Pages**
- Completely free
- Integrated workflow
- Good performance

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Tips**

### If Images Still Don't Load:
1. **Check asset paths** in built files
2. **Use absolute paths** from root
3. **Verify build output** has all images
4. **Check browser console** for 404 errors

### If Routing Doesn't Work:
- Ensure SPA redirects are configured
- Check that all `/*` routes go to `/index.html`

### If API Calls Fail:
- Check CORS settings on external APIs
- Verify environment detection logic
- Test API endpoints independently

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Choose your platform** from above options
2. **Follow the deploy steps** for that platform
3. **Test the deployed app** thoroughly
4. **Report back** which one works best!

I recommend starting with **Netlify** or **Surge** as they're most likely to "just work" with your current setup.
